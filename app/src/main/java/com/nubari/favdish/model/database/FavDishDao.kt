     * When data changes, you usually want to take some action, such as displaying the updated data in the UI.
     * This means you have to observe the data so when it changes, you can react.
     *
     * To observe data changes we will use Flow from kotlinx-coroutines.
     * Use a return value of type Flow in your method description,
     * and Room generates all necessary code to update the Flow when the database is updated.
     *
     * A Flow is an async sequence of values
     * Flow produces values one at a time (instead of all at once) that can generate values from async operations
     * like network requests, database calls, or other async code.
     * It supports coroutines throughout its API, so you can transform a flow using coroutines as well!
